        <li>Heat large pot over medium high heat. Add a drizzle of olive oil to pot. Once oil is hot, throw in the onion and garlic and cook until aromatic, about 1 minute. Add in meat and cook until browned. Drain off excess fat.</li>
        <li>Stir in undrained tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, sugar, italian seasoning, fennel seeds, salt, and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Stir until well mixed.</li>
        <li>Stir in the water or beef broth. Bring the sauce to a boil, then reduce the heat. Simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 1.5-2 hours until the sauce has come to the desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Cook the spaghetti noodles while the sauce simmers. Add salted water to a large pot and bring to a boil. Once boiling, cook the spaghetti until it is al dente.</li>
        <li>Once the spaghetti is done, drain the noodles and toss in remaining olive oil to prevent sticking. Taste the sauce for flavor and add salt and/or pepper as needed.</li>
