    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hummus is a dip/sauce originating from the mediterranean region. The primary main ingredient in hummus is the
        chickpea, or garbanzo bean. The secondary main ingredient is a paste made from sesame seeds called Tahini.</p>
    <p>Hummus can be found in many stores and mediterranean restaurants. It is often enjoyed with vegetables or pita
        bread. This classic mediterranean recipe is quick and easy to make and always worth it for the homemade
        goodness.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>15oz can of chickpeas, <em>drained and rinsed</em></li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, <em>1 large lemon</em></li>
        <li>1/4 cup tahini</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, <em>plus more for serving</em></li>
        <li>1/2 teaspon ground cumin</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons water, <em>or aquafaba*</em></li>
        <li>dash of ground paprika or sumac, <em>for serving</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine tahini and lemon juice in food processor(or blender) and process for 1 minute, scrape the sides and
            bottom of the bowl then process for 30 seconds more (this will help give the tahini a smoother consistency).
        </li>
        <li>Add the olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, and 1/2 a teaspoon of salt to the bowl. Process for 30 seconds,
            scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl then process another 30 seconds or until well blended. Add half of
            the chickpeas to the bowl then process for 1 minute. Scrape sides and bottom of the bowl, then add remaining
            chickpeas and process until smooth(1-2 minutes more).</li>
        <li>The hummus will likely still be too thick at this point. To make it smoother, turn on you food processor and
            slowly add the 2-3 tablespoons of water(or aquafaba) until you reach the desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Taste for flavor and add salt as needed. Top with a drizzle of olive oil and dash of paprika for serving.
            Store hummus in airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</li>
    </ol>
